Welcome to the **MarkdownLM Governance Rules** repository. This repository serves as the template for all technical constraints, architectural boundaries, style guides, and operational standards for the MarkdownLM ecosystem. 

By centralizing these rules into a machine-readable governance layer, AI agents and human developers can reliably build, scale, and maintain the platform without violating core invariants.
